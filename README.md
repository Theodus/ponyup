## Usage

### Installing Nightly Pony

The following command will download the latest nightly release of Ponyc and install it to `~/.pony/ponyup/bin` by default.

```bash
ponyup update nightly
```

## TODO
- Update init script to install nightly release of ponyup, add usage instructions
- Select default toolchain, rather than symlinking immediately on update
